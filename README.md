Based on the files retrieved from your repository, here's how you can run the code in your project:


### Instructions from `package.json`
The `package.json` file provides some scripts that can be used to run and manage your project. Here are the relevant scripts:

1. **Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command starts the development server using Vite.

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command builds the project for production.

3. **Preview the Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This command previews the built project.

4. **Lint the Project:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   This command runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   First, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build and Preview:**
   If you want to build the project for production and preview it:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

These steps should help you get the project up and running. If you encounter any issues, you may need to check the documentation for Vite or the specific dependencies used in the project.
